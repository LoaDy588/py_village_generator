general working idea:
1) generate grid
2) each cell has properties - road, river, forest, village, castle(castle entry)
    - some permutations dont work:castle + anything, village+forest, village+river
3) connect castle to village, village to some grid edge by road(some simple algorithm?)
4) generate the image, cell by cell - dont make the grid uniform maybe?

Notes:
 - trees can overlay roads(shadowing them)
 - if enough time left, maybe add some random scatter? or lakes
